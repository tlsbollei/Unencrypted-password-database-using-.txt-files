Important : Launch the script as administrator (or if using vscode, launch vscode as administrator) otherwise the script will be unable to read the contents of saved passwords and therefore will be uncapable of printing the content of the saved files.

Creates text files in the directory of the script (NEW function), the user inputs a username and a password and that file will be created in the directory with the script. The SAVED function will load already saved passwords - it will read the contents of the saved txt files in that directory.
Fun project - Please contribute, thinking of encrypting and decrypting the files using Fernet, or using .json format, or using sqlite3..... the possibilities are endless.
